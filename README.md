# About me, Mike

**Docent (associate professor), licensed clinical psychologist, PhD**  
Stockholm, Sweden  

I work at **Karolinska University Hospital** and I'm affiliated with a research group at **Karolinska Institutet**. My background spans leadership in healthcare, applying and implementing clinical psychology within healthcare, research within the field of behavioral medicine and chronic pain. These days I split my time between **clinical digitalisation**, **research**, and explorations of how I can contribute to **AI** safety and ethics.

## What I do

  - **Clinical digitalisation at the Karolinska University hospital**  
    - Supporting the broad implementation of **digital and hybrid (clinical) tools and workflows** within the organization.  
    - Supporting the development, implementation and evaluation of digital assessments, interventions and workflows to (potentially) deliver value for clinicians and patients at Theme Women's Health and Allied Health Professionals.

  - **Research**  
    - Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) for longstanding pain and other conditions.  
    - Psychometric evaluation of self-report questionnaires in chronic pain and other conditions. 
    - Studies on **ME/CFS** and **post-COVID-19 condition**, including symptom profiles. 


## What I’m currently curious about
- How AI tools actually behave “in the wild” – in real clinical settings, with real-world constraints.  
- Practical ways to evaluate **AI safety** and robustness from a non-technical/clinical perspective.
- How I can contribute to AI safety generally, and specifically related to potential near- and long-term risks of broad implementation of artificial generally intelligent autonomous systems.
